SysAdmin Tools
==============

A collection of tools I've written over the years to ease systems administration tasks

### Setup ###

Run

```make```

## Manual Setup ##

Fetch my shared library submodule

Enter the directory and run git submodule init and git submodule update to fetch my library repo:

```
cd sysadmin
```
```
git submodule init
```
```
git submodule update
```
This will pull in my git library repo which my modern plugins all leverage to give robust validation functions, utility functions, thresholds, default options, generated usage, logging levels and debug mode etc

You're now ready to use these programs.
